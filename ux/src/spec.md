We are going to enhance the home page for our app: index.html.
This app is an app for people doing retirement planning.




## New Presentation
Plans and Settings will go into a Hamburger Menu in the upper left.
There will be 2 columns:
1. Chat interaction. 
    The chat dialog will be an infinite scrolling window.
    User Chats and Assistant replies will alternate.
    New chats are appended at the end. Once the user has hit 'enter' on a chat box, that box becomes read-only. The user can't edit his/her chats once he has hit enter.
    Each user chat has a unique ChatQueryId (just liek now).
    There is the notion of a 'current chat'. This is the chat that the user last typed information into. Once the user hits enter, that chat dialog scrolls so that the user chat is at the top of the column.

2. Column 2 will be a panel containing the charts, tables, and other items that are currently in the chat stream.
